## 🧾 Description


This web application allows users to:
- Check the current weather and 5-day forecast for any city.
- Maintain a dynamic, persistent search history for previously searched cities.
- Learn to integrate front-end JavaScript with third-party APIs like OpenWeather.


Starter code was provided, but API integrations and routing logic were custom implemented.
